# Tanka Workshop

There are many configuration management approaches for Kubernetes. From plain
yaml to complex Ansible Playbooks, everything is possible. We evaluated many
solutions and found our perfect match with tanka and jsonnet. In this workshop
session, we'll migrate a yaml based Kubernetes deployment to tanka/jsonnet
together and refine it for scale. Afterwards, you'll be able to simplify
repetitive Kubernetes configurations and reuse common components across multiple
projects. To follow this workshop, you'll either need a Linux or MacOS
workstation. WSL2 will also work.
